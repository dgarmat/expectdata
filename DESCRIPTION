Title: Test Expectations of a Data Frame
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Dan", "Garmat", email = "dgarmat@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package runs expectation tests about data and returns an
    error when expectations are not met. Configuations allow that to be a 
    warning instead. Piping is assumed by default, so that the test returns
    the input data frame if no errors stop it. This means the test can be
    part of a dplyr pipeline. This helps diagnose errors coming from data
    sources that change in unexpected way early.
